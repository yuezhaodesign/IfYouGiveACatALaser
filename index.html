                <h2>Scene One</h2>
                <p>A small, red dot appears, flickering near the wall. The cat's ears perk up, eyes sharpening as it spots the light.</p>
                <p>Cat: (whispering in awe) "Oh! What's that? Could it be...a signal from…an alien spaceship?"</p>
                <p>The red dot dances across the floor, taunting the cat. The cat’s pupils dilate as it hunkers down, ready to pounce.</p>    
                <p>Cat: (scrambling after it, breathless) "Wait! Don't run! Don't run away!"</p>    
                <p>The dot zigzags and swerves, leading the cat on a wild chase, bouncing from wall to wall, and skittering across the floor.</p>
                <p>Cat: (desperately, paws stretching toward the dot) "Take me! Take me! I want to leave this planet!"</p>

                <h2>Scene Two</h2>
                    <p>A fluffy CAT is lounging on a cozy blanket, looking aloof. A HUMAN HAND slowly enters the frame, reaching to pet the cat.</p>
                    <p>Human Hand: (gently pets the cat)</p>
                    <p>Cat: (tensing up, fur bristling) "Don't touch me!!"(hisses and swats at the hand)</p>
                    <p>"Meow! Meow! Meow!"</p>
                    <p>The human hand quickly retracts, then reappears holding a small, colorful MOUSE TOY. The hand offers it to the cat.</p>
                    <p>Cat: (suddenly calm, eyeing the toy approvingly) "Much better."</p>
                    <p>(begins to paw at the toy, batting it around with interest)</p>
                    <p>The human hand slowly withdraws as the cat happily plays with the mouse toy.</p>
